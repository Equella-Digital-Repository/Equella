<h1>EQUELLA Script API</h1>
<p>The script object packages are broken into 'objects' and 'types'.  
<p>The classes in the objects packages are available in scripts using a pre-defined variable (the variable name is mentioned in each script object's documentation).  
The script objects are generally more service oriented than the script types.
<p>The classes in the types packages are generally only available by using the script objects (there are some rare exceptions like the script 'xml' variable which is an XmlScriptType, but is also used outside of the 'xml' script variable).  
The script types are generally just Java 'beans' which have simple get and set methods.
