<table class="zebra">\
<thead>\
<tr class="even"><th>Function</th><th>Description</th></tr>\
</thead>\
<tbody>\
<tr class="even"><td><strong>getCanonicalUrl()</strong></td><td>The canonical URL to the actual file, bypassing all viewers. "Latest version" selection will not work with this URL.</td></tr>\
<tr class="odd"><td><strong>getDefaultViewerUrl()</strong></td><td>Get the URL to view the resource with the default viewer.</td></tr>\
<tr class="even"><td><strong>getTitle()</strong></td><td>The title of the selected resource.</td></tr>\
<tr class="odd"><td><strong>getViewerUrl(String viewerId)</strong></td><td>Get the URL to view the resource with a specific viewer. In particular, the 'file' viewer is most useful since it allows "Latest version" selection to work and ultimately points to the canonical URL.</td></tr>\

For example:\
<pre>\
&lt;img src="${resource.getViewerUrl('file')}" alt="${title}" title="${title}" /&gt;<br>\
&lt;a href="${resource.getDefaultViewerUrl()}"&gt;View "${title}" with the default viewer&lt;a/&gt;\
</pre></div>
