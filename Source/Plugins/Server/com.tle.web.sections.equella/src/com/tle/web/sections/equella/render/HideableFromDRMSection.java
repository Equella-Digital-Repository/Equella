 * hidden. The exception is the SearchPrevNextSection. This provides the ability

 * viewing either the item summary, or the DRM filter screen where appropriate,
 * and in both cases to have the Next Prev buttons rendered and in the same
 * location on screen.<br>
 * Sections implementing this interface require a Model class which implements
