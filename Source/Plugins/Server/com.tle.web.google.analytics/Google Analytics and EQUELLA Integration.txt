Google Analytics Documentation for creating and adding the analytic id to EQUELLA

Step 1:	Registering with google for analytics id for a domain

	http://www.google.com/analytics/sign_up.html - sign up for google analytic account
	
Step 2: Website Profile
	Add a WebSite Profile on the main page of account(after creation)
	
	Based on a domain can have multiple profiles
	
	First time, check the radio button for Add a profile for a new domain

	* Make sure your site is web accessible.	
	enter the domain name - eg: http://beta40demo1.equella.com/pvt
	
	You would be given the analytic id eg: UA-7946848-1; along with javascript code 
	
	You can track multiple institutions as creating different profiles following the same 
	procedure mentioned above
	eg:
		Domain Name: http://beta40demo1.equella.com/pvt
		Profile: Profile for PVT institution on beta40demo1
		URL:	http://beta40demo1.equella.com/pvt/
		
		Domain Name: http://beta40demo1.equella.com/westone
		Profile: Profile for WestOne Institution on beta40demo1
		URL:	http://beta40demo1.equella.com/westone
		
	OR
		Domain Name: http://beta40demo2.equella.com/pvt
		Profile: Profile for PVT institution on beta40demo2
		URL:	http://beta40demo2.equella.com/pvt/
		
		Domain Name: http://beta40demo2.equella.com/westone
		Profile: Profile for WestOne Institution on beta40demo2

Step 3: adding the google analytic id to EQUELLA

	Now add the analytic id in GOOGLE ANALYTIC CONFIGURATION  step logged in as TLE_ADMINISTRATOR 
	
	Once you add the analytic id; a status of Tracking Enabled would be detected.
	
	You can check the status of the profile until it displays Receiving data on your Analytics Website Profile- generally takes between 6 hours to 24 hours
	
	After the status is updated to be as Receiving data - you can view the reports.
	
	Generally reports are defaulted to a previous day (i have no reason why) - to view the latest report change the date field to date you created your profile or current date
