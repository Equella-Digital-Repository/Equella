<h2>Magical Mystery Tour</h2>

<p>Magical Mystery Tour, the soundtrack to a forthcoming Beatles television film, appeared as a six-track double extended play disc (EP) in early December 1967. In the United States, the six songs were issued on an identically titled LP that also included tracks from the band's recent singles. Allmusic says of the US Magical Mystery Tour, &quot;The psychedelic sound is very much in the vein of Sgt. Pepper, and even spacier in parts (especially the sound collages of 'I Am the Walrus')&quot;, and calls its five songs culled from the band's 1967 singles &quot;huge, glorious, and innovative&quot;. It set a new US record in its first three weeks for highest initial sales of any Capitol LP, and it is the one Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band's official canon of studio albums. Aired on Boxing Day, the Magical Mystery Tour film, largely directed by McCartney, brought The Beatles their first major negative UK press. It was dismissed as &quot;blatant rubbish&quot; by the Daily Express, which described it as &quot;a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on, getting off, and riding on a bus&quot;. The Daily Mail called it &quot;a colossal conceit&quot;, while the Guardian labelled it &quot;a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience&quot;. It fared so dismally that it was withheld from the US at the time. In January, the group filmed a cameo for the animated movie Yellow Submarine, a fantasia featuring a cartoon version of The Beatles. The group's only other involvement with the film was the contribution of several unreleased studio recordings. Released in June 1968, it was well received for its innovative visual style and humour in addition to its music. It would be seven months, however, before the film's soundtrack album appeared.</p>
