## Download required software

**Download and install Git**

<https://git-scm.com/downloads>

In ubuntu:

```
~$ sudo apt-get install git
```

**SSH**

This guide assumes you have SSH capabilities.  Be sure to add your public SSH key into the you git profile to access the code repos.

**Download and install SBT**

<http://www.scala-sbt.org/>

In ubuntu:

```
~$ echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
~$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 2EE0EA64E40A89B84B2DF73499E82A75642AC823
~$ sudo apt-get update
~$ sudo apt-get install sbt
```

**Download and install Java 8 JDK**

<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>

Oracle is the recommended and historically the supported vendor of Java to run Equella with.

In ubuntu:
```
~$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
~$ sudo apt-get update
~$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
```

**Download and install Image Magick binaries**

<http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php>

*Note: For ubuntu follow the install from Unix Source instructions:*
<https://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php>

To confirm the installation directory in Ubuntu for the Equella installer, run the command:
```
~$ whereis convert
```

When installing in Windows, check “Install Legacy Utilities (e.g. convert)”.

**Download and install libav**

In ubuntu:

```
~$ sudo apt-get install libav-tools
```

To confirm the installation directory in Ubuntu for the Equella installer, run the command:
```
~$ whereis avconv
```


Once SBT and Java are installed, you may need to set a JAVA_HOME environment variable.

**Database**

* Either [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), SQLServer, or Oracle database.

## Get the code

### Base code
**Git Clone**
```
~$ git clone git@github.com:equella/Equella.git
```

### Optional code
There is functionality that could not be included into the core Equella code repository, but based on your business needs, may be appropriate to include.
* Oracle DB Driver
* [Kaltura](https://equella.github.io/optional-functionality/Kaltura.html)

## Build configuration

Some aspects of the build can be configured by editing the `build.conf` file.

### Keystore

A keystore with a certificate is required to sign some of the jars in order for them to escape the Java sandbox.

By default the build will generate a self signed key which will show security warnings when launching.
In order to prevent this you will need to have a properly [signed certificate](https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/java-code-signing-guide.htm) and configure the build to use it.
In the `build.conf` file you can modify the parameters to configure your own keystore:

```conf
signer {
  keystore = "/path/to/.keystore"
  storePassword = "<storepasswd>"
  keyPassword = "<optional>" # defaults to storePassword
  alias = "<keyalias>"
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: A self registered certificate implies that the jars won't be secured and a security exception will appear when trying to launch the jars.
To avoid this it is needed to add the domain you want to trust as a security exception in your java configuration.
It can be done with the Java Control Panel or directly adding the domain in a new line in this file:
${user.home}/.java/deployment/security/exception.sites

## Building the code
This guide runs sbt in non-interactive mode.  You can run in interactive mode to save rebuild time by first running 'sbt', and the another command such as 'compile'.

```bash
cd to the {Equella repo} directory
~$ sbt compile
```

### Equella Configuration

EQUELLA requires a configuration folder (`learningedge-config`) in order to start and there
is an sbt task which will generate configuration files suitable for running with your dev environment:

```bash
sbt prepareDevConfig
```

This will create a configuration in the `{Equella repo}/Dev/learningedge-config` folder which you can
modify for your needs, in particular you will need to configure `hibernate.properties` to point to
the database that you have created for EQUELLA.

### Running a dev instance

Ensure you have your `Dev/learningedge-config` setup.  See [Equella Configuration](#equella-configuration).

```bash
~$ sbt compile equellaserver/run
```

### Running a dev instance of the admin tool

Ensure you have your `Dev/learningedge-config` setup.  See [Equella Configuration](#equella-configuration).

```bash
~$ sbt compile adminTool/run
```

## Installation of the Vanilla institution

Really any instituion is sufficient.  Under the 'Installing Equella' page, there is a guide to a 'Vanilla' institution that would be suitable for a development environment.

## SBT Notes
The new build uses SBT (very flexible and has a large set of useful plugins available). You can customize pretty much any aspect of your build process using Scala scripts.

Plugins are global to the build but can be turned on/off on a per project basis.

The root build is located in the following files:

* `build.sbt`
* `project/*.scala`
* `project/plugins.sbt`

Located in the "project" folder is a series of SBT AutoPlugins which are responsible for replicating some of what the ant build used to do:

* `JPFScanPlugin` - scanning for plugin projects
* `JPFPlugin` - default folder layout and settings for JPF plugin projects
* `JPFRunnerPlugin` - collecting plugins for deployment or running

The root plugin manually defines the sub-project location and their inter-project dependencies:

* `equellaserver` - contains the server bootstrap code and contains the dependency list for the server, produces the upgrade zip
* `InstallerZip` - produces the installer zip
* `UpgradeZip` - produces the upgrade zip
* `UpgradeInstallation` - the installation upgrader which is part of the upgrade zip
* `UpgradeManager` - the upgrade manager web app
* `conversion` - the conversion service
* `allPlugins` - an aggregate project which can be used for building all the JPF plugins
* `adminTool` - contains the admin console client launcher

### Misc
if you get a deduplicate dependencies on commons logging, SLF4J has a moonlighting jar that says it's commons logging.  Use the build.sbt directive of exclude dependencies like the adminConsole does.

### Speeding up the build during dev

If you are editing the build files you can temporarily disable all the non-essential plugins to speed up your dev/reload/test process by editing (or creating) the `project/build.conf` file to have the setting:

```
plugin.whitelist = []
```

## IntelliJ
Building Equella with SBT does not require an IDE to run, and while not a particular IDE is not recommended / required, IntelliJ has been proven to work with the Equella SBT build process.

Due to the enourmous number of projects, when importing into IntelliJ the required memory usage will be higher than the default, so you'll probably need to increase the memory (`Help -> Edit custom VM Options...`)

You will also need to increase the default maximum memory allocation for SBT when doing the import: (`Build Tools -> SBT -> Maximum Heap size`)

4096MB should be enough.
